# GParareal: a time-parallel ODE solver using Gaussian process emulation

This repository contains sample code for the pre-print by Pentland, Tamborrino, Sullivan, Buchanan and Appel - "GParareal: a time-parallel ODE solver using Gaussian process emulation" (arXiv link).

The code is written in MATLAB and requires the use of the following toolboxes (noting there may be dependencies I have overlooked):
* Parallel Computing Toolbox.
* GPstuff package (download/install instructions at: https://github.com/gpstuff-dev/gpstuff).
