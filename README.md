# GParareal: A time-parallel ODE solver using Gaussian process emulation

This repository contains sample code for the pre-print by Pentland, Tamborrino, Sullivan, Buchanan, and Appel - "GParareal: A time-parallel ODE solver using Gaussian process emulation" (insert arXiv link here).

The code is written in MATLAB and requires the use of the following toolboxes (note there may be dependencies I have overlooked):
* Parallel Computing Toolbox.
* GPstuff (download/install instructions at: https://github.com/gpstuff-dev/gpstuff).
